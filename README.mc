# 68000 board

Interfacing Motorola 68000 CPU with ROM, SRAM, and ACIA 6850 to connect a RS232 terminal.  I did this to get familiar with Motorola 16bit style CPU-control bus that differed much from the Motorola 6502’s and Intel 8088’s which I studied in earlier experiments.

I soldered the components together using wire-wrap cable.  I used the same cabling for the prototypes that I built for Security Electronics 1996.
